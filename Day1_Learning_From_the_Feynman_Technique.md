“In order to talk to each other, we have to have words, and that’s all right. It’s a good idea to try to see the difference, and it’s a good idea to know when we are teaching the tools of science, such as words, and when we are teaching science itself,” Feynman said.  

Essentially, the Feynman Technique is this:

1. Identify the subject
2. Teach it to a child
3. Identify your knowledge gaps
4. Organize + simplify + Tell a story


費曼學習法分為四個步驟：

1. 研究/學習一項新的主題
2. 教別人。例如小孩子，最主要是要最淺顯普通的詞彙，不要用任何專業術語。
3. 找出別人聽不懂的地方，然後重新回頭學習。
4. 精煉簡化，確定已經沒有任何借來的詞彙與行話。

### Drawing on passions
Feynman was a believer in a multi-disciplinary approach to learning and found connections to his work in creative outlets like drawing and music. He never stopped asking questions — who, what, and why?

### Making things stick forever
The next time you stare at an empty notebook page, think about turning that page into an opportunity.
